# Matrix-Element-Validation-Program-in-C-
a C++ program that prompts the user to enter the elements of a 5x5 matrix. The program should validate each element to ensure that it is less than 100. If an element is 100 or greater, the user should be prompted to re-enter a value for that element. After all elements have been validated and entered, the program should display the updated matrix.
